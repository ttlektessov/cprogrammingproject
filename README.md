# Final Project on Advanced C Class
My final project on Advanced C Class, where I wrote a phone book application, to store information including name, phone number and birth date.
In this project I used dynamic memory allocation, reading from file and pointers concepts which I learned during this course.

To use this program, simply enter the number of people you want to store in the application, and then use the app according to the menu.

Have fun!
